# Salesforce-Authorization

How it works:
-> Contains code for authorizing into salesforce using the 'OAuth 2.0 Web Server Flow for Web App Integration' flow. 
-> It collects the Connected App credentials of the server hosting this flow.

How to use:
-> Enter your domain name in the input text box otherwise the the default domain name, 'https://dextaradigital-7f-dev-ed.lightning.force.com/' will be considered and click on Login.
-> Page2 will now open with loading circle and check the console for the Access Token.
